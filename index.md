# LinqCheck - Property Based Testing with LINQ Expressions

Property based testing refers to a software verification method where the
test cases are generated by a computer. This tehcnique was first introduced in 
the [QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck) library that was 
originally developed for the purely functional programming language 
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/). As the name implies, instead of testing 
individual scenarios we write down the properties that should hold for 
arbitrary input data. We rely on the testing framework to come up with various
input states that might break the specified properties. In a sense, the 
software is trying to prove your assumptions wrong. 

If the library finds a case where any of the properties do no hold, it will 
reduce the case to a minimal counter example that still fails. This is a much 
better starting point to analyzing the problem, than getting an exception
or assertion error in the middle of a program execution. The flow of events
that lead to the error could be numerous and hard to recreate. Also, it is 
might be difficult to discern which actions are relevant for reproducing
the problem and which are not.

Property based testing generally works best for testing pure functions
whose result depend only on the input. However, one of the inventors of 
QuickCheck [John Hughes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(computer_scientist))
has demonstrated that it is possible to also test imperative probrams with
property based testing. Rather than generating input data, we can create a 
sequences of function calls that modify the state of an imperative piece of 
software. When a failing sequence is found, the library can again reduce it 
to a minimal example that produces the same error.

There are a lot of resources in the Internet to learn more about property
based testing, but I would recommend the reading the
[original paper](http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/~robby/courses/395-495-2009-fall/quick.pdf)
by Hughes and Koen Classen. It not only introduces the concept but also
explains how the library is implemented in a very clear way. The paper assumes
the reader to be familiar with Haskell, which might be an obstacle. But if you 
are, it completely demystifies the concept which truly seems magical at first.

## LinqCheck

As you might have guessed LinqCheck is basically a port of QuickCheck for C#.
It implements all of the concepts present in QuickCheck, but tries to provide 
an API which feels natural in C#, and not mimic the original design too much.
It also serves as a good example of how to program in C# like it was a
functional programming language. You can get surprisingly far with C# language 
features and write elegant and readable code, if you follow the functional
principles. It goes to prove that the ideas of FP are applicable widely,
and it pays of to learn functional programming languages, even if you are 
not using one in your daily work.

Another feature you might have figured from the name is that LinqCheck 
utilizes the syntactic sugaring provided by LINQ - heavily. It is no 
coincidence that the way how LINQ expressions work resembles the concept of 
[monad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)) in 
Haskell. [Erik Meijer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)),
who is widely credited to be the father of LINQ, was also involved in the
design of Haskell language and compiler. Understanding the correspondence
between monads and LINQ helps transferring some of the features from QuickCheck
to C#. 

## Getting Started

It is easiest to look at a few examples first on how LinqCheck is used. The
concepts of LinqCheck are introduced in the Examples section. If you are 
interested only to use the library, you can stop there. But if you want to
learn how the library is implemented, you can continue reading the 
documentation that is generated with the 
[Literate Programming](https://johtela.github.io/LiterateProgramming/) tool.
That tool is actually a great accompanion to LinqCheck. By documenting your
properties you will also get live documentation for your tests, and 
essentially a specification on how the code you are testing works.
