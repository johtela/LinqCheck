<blockquote>
<p>There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it
so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to
make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first
method is far more difficult.</p>
<p>C.A.R. Hoare in his 1980 Turing Award Lecture</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Tony Hoare's</a> famous quote
is undoubtedly correct, it is increasingly difficult nowadays to design software
so simple that it is obviously bug-free by design. Software gets more and
more complex every day, and usually the only practical way to assure its quality
is to test it thoroughly. Design is important, as is aspiration for simplicity,
but they don't guarantee error free programs.</p>
<p>Another famous quote by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Edsger W. Dijkstra</a>
says that testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs. However, the
term testing can refer to many types of activities. We should recognize that
the number and types of bugs we find varies greatly depending on the kind of
testing we perform. The stricter and more systematic our approach is, the more
value we get out of it.</p>
<p>The problem is that testing can be a very tedious and time consuming task. Even
automated tests require a lot of work and discipline to be effective in
discovering bugs. So, we should continuously seek ways to improve our testing
strategies, and explore new methods with an open mind. The best we could hope
for is a technique which reduces the amount of test code we need to write while
revealing more bugs, and even new kinds of bugs. Is there an approach that
could satisfy these requirements? I think there is.</p>
<h2 id="property-based-testing">Property Based Testing</h2>
<p>Property based testing refers to a software verification method where the
test cases are generated by a computer. This tehcnique was first introduced in
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck">QuickCheck</a> library,
originally developed for the purely functional programming language
<a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a>. As the name &quot;property based testing&quot; hints,
the idea is to specify properties that should hold for arbitrary input data,
not just for a single test case. Typically a testing library similar to
Quickcheck is used to produce random input and test the specified properties.
In a sense, the testing library is trying to prove our assumptions wrong by
searching for counter-examples.</p>
<p>If the library finds a case where one or more properties do not hold, it will
reduce the case to a minimal example that still fails. This is a much better
starting point for analyzing the problem than getting an exception or
assertion error in the middle of program execution. The program flow that led
to the error can be lengthy and hard to reproduce. Also, it  might be difficult
to discern which actions are relevant for reproducing the problem and which
are not.</p>
<p>Property based testing generally works best for testing pure functions
whose result depend only on their input. However, the co-inventor of QuickCheck
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hughes_(computer_scientist)">John Hughes</a>
has demonstrated that it is possible to test also imperative programs with
property based testing. Rather than generating input data directly, we create
sequences of function calls that modify the program's mutable state. When a
failing sequence is found, the library reduces it to a minimal example that
produces the same error.</p>
<p>There are a lot of resources on the Internet to learn more about property
based testing, but I would recommend reading the
<a href="http://www.eecs.northwestern.edu/%7Erobby/courses/395-495-2009-fall/quick.pdf">original paper</a>
by Hughes and Koen Classen. It not only introduces the concept but also
explains how the library is implemented in an easy-to-follow way. The paper
assumes the reader to be familiar with Haskell, which might be an obstacle.
If you are proficient with the basics of Haskell though, the paper even
serves as a guide on how to implement the library in some other programming
language.</p>
<h2 id="linqcheck">LinqCheck</h2>
<p>As you might have guessed LinqCheck is a port of QuickCheck for C#. It
implements all of the concepts present in QuickCheck, and tries to provide
an API which feels natural, not mimicking the original design too much. It
also aims to demonstrate how you can program in C# like it was a functional
programming language. You can write really elegant and simple code by following
the principles of FP; the kind of obviously correct code that Tony Hoare was
referring to in his speech. The ideas of functional programming are applicable
in any programming language that has the few required constructs such as
closures and function types.</p>
<p>Another feature you might deduce from the name is that LinqCheck is built on
the language facilities provided by LINQ. It is no coincidence that LINQ
expressions resemble very much <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_(functional_programming)">monads</a>
in Haskell. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)">Erik Meijer</a>,
who is commonly credited to be the creator of LINQ, was involved in the design of
Haskell language. So, naturally he designed LINQ using the same concepts that
proved to be very powerful in Haskell. Understanding the correspondence between
monads and LINQ helps porting the features of QuickCheck from Haskell to C# as
the orginal implementation utilizes monads in many places.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The easiest way to learn LinqCheck is by example. The first part of this
documentation covers several test examples and introduces the most important
features of the library. If you are only interested in how to use the library,
you can read just those chapters. But if you want to learn how the library works
under the hood, you can continue reading the following chapters which cover the
whole implementation.</p>
<p>This documentation is generated with the
<a href="https://johtela.github.io/LiterateProgramming/">Literate Programming</a> tool,
which I developed based on the ideas proposed by
<a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>. Literate programming
is a methodology that encourages writing documentation in tandem with code.
It offers a way to provide comprehensive documentation for programs whose
workings you want to explicate to others and especially to yourself.</p>
<p>The Literate Programming tool is actually a great accompanion to LinqCheck. By
documenting your properties and test code you will also get live documentation
which specifies in natural language how the code you are testing works.</p>
<h3 id="obtaining-and-installing-the-library">Obtaining and Installing the Library</h3>
<p>You can download the library as a Nuget package from <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">nuget.org</a>.</p>
